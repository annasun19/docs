</Info>

## Making API Requests

All API requests should be made to `https://api.getnowadays.com`. The API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer token authentication:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Request Example

Here's a complete example of creating an event using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.getnowadays.com/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Annual Sales Conference",
    "venue_type": "Conference Center",
    "event_type": "Conference",
    "start_date": "2024-09-15T00:00:00Z",
    "end_date": "2024-09-17T00:00:00Z",
    "location": "Austin, TX",
    "budget": 75000,
    "num_people": 200,
    "num_hotel_rooms_needed": 100,
    "decision_deadline": "2024-07-01T00:00:00Z"
  }'
```

## Rate Limits

<Tip>
  Our standard API rate limit is 100 requests per minute. Contact us if you need a higher limit.
</Tip>

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes:
- 2xx for successful requests
- 4xx for client errors
- 5xx for server errors

Example error response:
```json
{
  "error": 400,
  "message": "Invalid event dates: start_date must be in the future"
}
```

## Best Practices

    We recommend implementing webhook handlers to receive real-time updates about venue proposals and quote changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pagination">
    When retrieving lists of venues or quotes, use the limit parameter to control the response size:
    ```bash
    curl https://api.getnowadays.com/events/{eventId}/venues?limit=10
    ```
  </Accordion>
